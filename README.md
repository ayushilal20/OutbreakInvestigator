## Project Overview

OutbreakInvestigator aims to provide a robust and reliable methodology for identifying and characterizing pathogens responsible for infectious disease outbreaks. The project is divided into the following main steps:

### 1. QC and Assembly
Quality control and assembly of sequencing data are crucial first steps in the identification process. This step involves cleaning the raw sequencing data and assembling the genome sequences to facilitate downstream analyses.

### 2. Gene Prediction and Annotation
In this phase, we predict and annotate genes within the assembled genomes. This step is critical for understanding the genetic content of the pathogen and involves using tools such as Prodigal and Bakta.

### 3. Genotyping and Taxonomic Classification
Genotyping and taxonomic classification help identify the specific strains and species of the pathogen. This step provides insights into the pathogen's genetic variability and evolutionary relationships.

### 4. Comparative Genomics
Comparative genomics is used to compare the genomes of the pathogen with known references to pinpoint the organism responsible for the outbreak. This involves using tools like FastANI and gSearch to perform comprehensive comparative analyses.

## My Contributions

I was an integral part of Teams 2 and 4, contributing significantly to the gene prediction and annotation, as well as leading the comparative genomics efforts.

### Team 4: Comparative Genomics
As the lead of the Comparative Genomics team, I spearheaded the final phase of the project. My responsibilities included:
- Evaluating different tools to find the most appropriate ones for accomplishing the project tasks.
- Using Roary for pangenome analysis.
- Generating required images using Roary and pyGenomeViz.
- Successfully identifying the pathogen and providing a detailed recommendation report to the CDC.

Through our rigorous analysis, we were able to conclude the project by accurately finding the organism responsible for the outbreak, demonstrating the efficacy and reliability of the pipelines developed.

## Conclusion

OutbreakInvestigator showcases a successful integration of various bioinformatics tools and methodologies to identify infectious agents responsible for outbreaks. The project's findings have significant implications for public health and highlight the importance of comprehensive genomic analyses in outbreak investigations.
